# DESIGN.md — MUTYA STOREFRONT DESIGN SYSTEM v2

> **Purpose:** Visual source of truth for the Mutya hijab e-commerce storefront.
>
> **Brand:** Mutya
>
> **Direction:** Soft Luxury Feminine + Editorial Fashion Commerce
>
> **Stack:** Laravel 13 + Blade + Tailwind CSS v4
>
> **Implementation rule:** Read this file before creating or modifying customer-facing UI.

---

# 1. DESIGN NORTH STAR

Mutya should feel like a **real Indonesian hijab fashion brand**, not a Laravel template and not a generic marketplace.

The previous design direction remains correct in its brand fundamentals:

- Pink
- Cream
- Feminine
- Floral
- Elegant
- Premium

However, the UI must become more **editorial, confident, visual, and commerce-focused**.

## Core visual statement

> **Soft femininity with a modern editorial fashion-store experience.**

Think:

```text
Premium modest-fashion editorial
        +
Modern Indonesian e-commerce
        +
Subtle botanical identity
```

Do NOT make the site feel like:

```text
❌ Generic CRUD dashboard
❌ Marketplace clone
❌ Pink children's website
❌ Bubble-heavy SaaS UI
❌ Every section inside a rounded white card
❌ Floral decoration everywhere
```

The brand personality should be:

```text
GRACEFUL
CONFIDENT
SOFT
MODERN
FASHIONABLE
WARM
TRUSTWORTHY
```

---

# 2. DESIGN BENCHMARK / REFERENCE DIRECTION

The following websites are references for **information architecture, merchandising, editorial composition, and shopping experience only**.

Do not copy their branding, logo, typography, images, copy, or exact layouts.

## Lozy

Reference:
https://lozy.id/

Useful lessons:
- Strong product/category merchandising.
- Large product taxonomy makes it easy to browse by material/series.
- Best Seller and product-group navigation are prominent.
- The store feels like a fashion catalog rather than a generic shop grid.

Source observed from the current site: extensive navigation around product families such as Paris, Voal, Rayon, Viscose, Tencel, Silk, Jersey, and Ceruty, plus Best Seller groupings. 

## Elzatta

Reference:
https://elzatta.com/

Useful lessons:
- Strong editorial product storytelling.
- Product photography receives large visual space.
- Product pages explain comfort, coverage, material, finishing, and color choice.
- Shopping is supported by useful decision aids such as color/undertone guidance.
- Hero/product storytelling is more editorial than a basic product grid.

Source observed from the current site: hero product storytelling, feature blocks for Comfort/Coverage/Material/Finishing, color discovery, and an undertone guide. 

## Kenan Hijab

Reference:
https://kenanhijab.co.id/home/

Useful lessons:
- Promotional merchandising is visually prominent.
- Product cards communicate sale pricing clearly.
- New Arrival and Popular product groups create shopping momentum.
- Editorial/news and brand activity are mixed with commerce content.
- The homepage combines products, promotions, social proof/brand activity, and offline-store information.

Source observed from the current site: promotional product sections, New Arrival/Popular groupings, offline-store links, and editorial/news content. 

## Mutya decision

Borrow the **principles**, not the identity:

```text
Lozy:
Category depth + merchandising

Elzatta:
Editorial storytelling + product education

Kenan:
Promotion + new arrivals + brand activity

Mutya:
Soft luxury + floral identity + clean editorial commerce
```

---

# 3. VISUAL HIERARCHY

The old system was too card-heavy.

New rule:

> **Not every section needs a card.**

Use a mixture of:

- full-bleed image sections
- editorial split layouts
- product grids
- soft-background sections
- whitespace-led sections
- thin dividers
- floating badges
- occasional cards

## Visual priority

```text
1. Fashion/product photography
2. Brand message
3. Product information
4. CTA
5. Supporting UI
6. Decoration
```

Floral decoration is always last in priority.

---

# 4. COLOR SYSTEM — KEEP THE BRAND

The brand colors remain unchanged.

## Primary

```text
--primary-pink: #EFA7C1
--deep-pink: #D98FAF
--soft-pink: #F8C8DC
```

## Neutrals

```text
--cream: #FFF9F5
--white: #FFFFFF
--surface: #FCF7F8
--text-primary: #3A3033
--text-secondary: #75686D
--border: #EBDDE2
```

## Accent

```text
--gold: #C9A227
--mauve: #B97897
```

## Color ratios

Approximate visual balance:

```text
50–60% white / cream
20–25% photography / natural product colors
10–15% soft pink
5–10% deep pink / mauve
<5% gold
```

## Important change

Do NOT tint every element pink.

Pink should identify:
- CTA
- active state
- selected state
- editorial highlights
- small brand accents

Cream and white must dominate the canvas.

---

# 5. ART DIRECTION

This is the biggest visual upgrade.

## Photography direction

Prefer:

- editorial hijab photography
- soft daylight
- natural skin tones
- textured fabric close-ups
- clean studio product shots
- warm neutral environments
- sophisticated female styling
- movement in fabric
- close-up details

## Avoid

- generic stock photography
- overly posed corporate images
- oversaturated pink photos
- heavy artificial glow
- unrealistic AI-looking model imagery
- busy backgrounds

## Product imagery

Product photos should feel consistent:

```text
4:5 ratio
soft light
neutral background
accurate color
consistent crop
```

Where multiple images exist:

1. hero/product image
2. lifestyle image
3. close-up material image
4. color/variant image

---

# 6. TYPOGRAPHY

## Display / Editorial

Primary:

```text
Playfair Display
```

Alternative:

```text
Cormorant Garamond
```

Use for:

- hero headline
- editorial statements
- section headlines
- campaign headlines
- product storytelling headlines

## UI / Commerce

Primary:

```text
Poppins
```

Alternative:

```text
Inter
```

Use for:

- navigation
- prices
- buttons
- filters
- forms
- product metadata
- badges

## Typography hierarchy

Hero:
```text
clamp(2.5rem, 7vw, 5.5rem)
```

Section heading:
```text
clamp(1.75rem, 4vw, 3.25rem)
```

Product title:
```text
0.95rem – 1.05rem
```

Product price:
```text
0.95rem – 1.1rem
```

Micro-label:
```text
0.65rem – 0.75rem
```

Use letter-spacing carefully.

Do NOT make every heading bold.

---

# 7. LAYOUT PHILOSOPHY

## Container

Desktop:

```text
max-width: 1280px
```

Wide editorial sections may use:

```text
max-width: 1440px
```

Mobile:

```text
padding-inline: 16px
```

Tablet:

```text
padding-inline: 24px
```

Desktop:

```text
padding-inline: 32px
```

## Grid

Prefer asymmetric layouts where useful.

Examples:

```text
2/5 + 3/5
3/5 + 2/5
1/3 + 2/3
```

Do not make every section a 50/50 split.

---

# 8. SPACING

Base rhythm:

```text
4
8
12
16
20
24
32
40
48
64
80
96
120
```

Homepage section spacing:

Desktop:
```text
80–120px
```

Mobile:
```text
56–72px
```

Product grids:
```text
16–24px
```

Editorial sections:
```text
64–96px
```

Whitespace should feel intentional and luxurious.

---

# 9. BORDER RADIUS

The previous UI overused rounded containers.

New rule:

> **Use radius strategically, not everywhere.**

Recommended:

```text
Image/media: 16–20px
Product cards: 12–16px
Buttons: 10–12px
Input: 10–12px
Pills: 9999px
Editorial section: often NO container radius
```

Large hero sections may use square/soft corners instead of a giant rounded rectangle.

---

# 10. SHADOWS

Prefer depth through:

- whitespace
- contrast
- image composition
- subtle borders

Default:

```text
0 8px 30px rgba(58, 48, 51, 0.05)
```

Hover:

```text
0 14px 40px rgba(58, 48, 51, 0.09)
```

Do not use shadows on every section.

---

# 11. FLORAL SYSTEM — MORE REFINED

Floral decoration stays, but becomes more sophisticated.

## Preferred

- botanical line-art
- fine rose outlines
- thin stems
- petal silhouettes
- hand-drawn botanical sketches
- pressed-flower inspired elements
- small floral marks

## Placement

Best:

- hero edge
- campaign section edge
- footer corner
- editorial image overlay at very low opacity
- empty states
- divider accents

Avoid:

- repeating flowers on every card
- flowers next to every heading
- flowers behind product prices
- flowers over buttons

## Opacity

```text
8% – 25%
```

Occasionally:

```text
30% max
```

Floral decoration should be discovered, not shouted.

---

# 12. BRAND MARK

Logo direction:

```text
❀ MUTYA
```

or

```text
MUTYA
small floral mark
```

Keep it simple.

Do not turn the flower into a complicated logo illustration.

---

# 13. NAVIGATION — PREMIUM FASHION STORE

## Desktop

Recommended:

```text
          MUTYA

SHOP   COLLECTIONS   ABOUT   JOURNAL        SEARCH  ♡  BAG
```

If the content width allows, account can appear inside a utility area.

## Header behavior

- transparent/overlay over hero where appropriate
- transitions to white/cream when scrolling
- thin bottom border
- restrained shadow
- sticky

This creates a more editorial experience than a permanently boxed navbar.

## Mobile

Use:

```text
☰     MUTYA     ♡   BAG
```

or:

```text
☰     MUTYA     BAG
```

Search can expand into a full-width search panel.

Mobile navigation must feel intentional, not like a desktop menu collapsed into a hamburger.

---

# 14. HOMEPAGE — NEW STRUCTURE

Homepage should feel like a fashion campaign.

Recommended order:

```text
1. Announcement bar
2. Hero campaign
3. Category / Shop by style
4. Best sellers
5. Editorial brand story
6. New arrivals
7. Product education / material spotlight
8. Campaign / promotion
9. Social proof / reviews
10. Social gallery
11. Newsletter
12. Footer
```

The homepage must NOT be:

```text
Hero
rounded card
rounded card
rounded card
rounded card
rounded card
```

Instead alternate visual rhythms.

---

# 15. ANNOUNCEMENT BAR

Minimal.

Example:

```text
Free shipping for selected orders ✦
```

or:

```text
New Collection — Discover Your Everyday Favorite
```

Height:

```text
32–38px
```

Do not overcrowd.

---

# 16. HERO — EDITORIAL FIRST

The hero should be the biggest visual upgrade.

## Desktop

Use a large image-led composition.

Preferred structure:

```text
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                              │
│  small eyebrow                              │
│  ELEGANCE IN EVERY WRAP                     │
│                                              │
│  Discover                                    │
│  your everyday                               │
│  signature.                    [MODEL IMAGE] │
│                                              │
│  short copy                     floral edge  │
│  [SHOP COLLECTION]                           │
│                                              │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Do not place the entire hero inside a tiny rounded card.

## Mobile

Stack:

```text
eyebrow
headline
copy
CTA
hero image
```

Image should remain visually dominant.

---

# 17. SHOP BY STYLE / CATEGORY

Instead of generic equal cards, use an editorial arrangement.

Example:

```text
        Shop by Style

[ PASHMINA large ]
[ VOAL ] [ SEGI EMPAT ]
[ SATIN ] [ CERUTY ]
```

Use different card sizes where useful.

Category labels should remain simple.

Use real category data.

---

# 18. BEST SELLER SECTION

Section heading:

```text
Most Loved
```

Supporting line:

```text
Pilihan yang paling sering dipilih untuk menemani hari-harimu.
```

Use a horizontal scroll on mobile when appropriate.

Desktop:
3–4 products

Mobile:
1.2–2 products visible for a premium carousel feel

Product card should show:

- image
- favorite
- badge
- title
- material
- rating
- price
- compare price

Do not put every piece of metadata on the card.

---

# 19. PRODUCT CARD — NEW STANDARD

Product cards should be visually cleaner.

Structure:

```text
┌─────────────────────┐
│                     │
│    PRODUCT IMAGE    │
│                 ♡   │
│                     │
│  BEST SELLER        │
└─────────────────────┘

Product Name
Voal Premium
★★★★★

Rp99.000
Rp129.000
```

### Interaction

On desktop:
- subtle image zoom
- optional image swap on hover
- wishlist animates
- CTA appears subtly

On mobile:
- no hover dependency
- actions visible/tappable

Do not put giant Add to Cart buttons under every product card.

---

# 20. NEW ARRIVALS

Use a more energetic section.

Heading:

```text
Just In
```

Add:

```text
View All →
```

Use actual latest products.

Use small product labels:

```text
NEW
```

not oversized badges.

---

# 21. EDITORIAL BRAND STORY

This is the major missing piece from the old design.

Use an editorial split:

```text
[ Large editorial image ]

                     About Mutya
                     A quiet kind of
                     everyday elegance.

                     short brand story

                     [Discover Our Story →]
```

Background:
- cream
- white
- very subtle botanical line-art

Purpose:
Make Mutya feel like a **brand**, not only a store.

---

# 22. MATERIAL / PRODUCT EDUCATION

Inspired by the product-education approach visible on premium hijab stores.

Possible blocks:

```text
Why Voal?
Light. Cool. Easy to style.

Why Ceruty?
Flowy texture with an effortless drape.

Why Silk?
Soft sheen for elevated moments.
```

Do NOT invent claims that are not supported by actual product data.

When possible, use product material data from the database.

This section can link directly to filtered products.

---

# 23. PROMOTIONAL CAMPAIGN

Use one strong campaign block instead of many banners.

Example:

```text
THE EVERYDAY EDIT

20% OFF SELECTED STYLES

[SHOP NOW]
```

Visual:
- large image
- pink/cream text panel
- subtle floral decoration

Avoid discount-site aesthetics.

---

# 24. REVIEWS / SOCIAL PROOF

Use actual reviews where possible.

Layout:

```text
“quote”

★★★★★

Customer Name
Verified Purchase
```

If there are not enough reviews:
- use a graceful empty state
- do not fabricate customer claims

Optional:
- customer photo grid
- review photo masonry

---

# 25. SOCIAL GALLERY

A clean visual grid.

Prefer:

```text
2 columns mobile
4 columns desktop
```

Mix:
- product
- lifestyle
- packaging
- detail

Avoid oversized Instagram logo decoration.

---

# 26. NEWSLETTER / COMMUNITY

Instead of a basic input box, create a stronger brand statement.

Example:

```text
A little beauty, delivered.

Join the Mutya list for new collections,
special offers, and styling inspiration.

[ Email Address              ][ Join ]
```

Background:
cream/pink

Optional botanical edge.

---

# 27. FOOTER

Footer should feel editorial and premium.

Columns:

```text
MUTYA
Quietly elegant hijabs for everyday moments.

SHOP
New Arrivals
Best Sellers
All Hijabs
Categories

HELP
Shipping
Returns
Order Tracking
FAQ
Contact

FOLLOW
Instagram
TikTok
WhatsApp
```

Add newsletter/social CTA.

---

# 28. SHOP PAGE

The shop page should feel like a fashion catalog.

Top:

```text
Shop Hijab

short editorial intro
```

Then:

```text
Search
Category
Material
Color
Price
Sort
```

## Desktop

Filter sidebar optional.

## Mobile

Use:

```text
[ Filter ] [ Sort ]
```

as sticky/top controls.

Use a slide-over/bottom sheet instead of a permanently visible sidebar.

---

# 29. PRODUCT DETAIL

Product detail should feel premium and educational.

## Desktop

```text
IMAGE GALLERY      PRODUCT INFO

                    Product Name
                    Material
                    Rating
                    Price
                    Color
                    Variant
                    Quantity
                    Add to Cart
                    Buy Now
```

## Mobile

```text
image
gallery dots
name
rating
price
color
variant
stock
CTA
description
material
reviews
related products
```

CTA can become sticky at the bottom on mobile.

---

# 30. PRODUCT COLOR SELECTION

Use real color swatches.

Swatch:

```text
●
```

Selected state:
- 1–2px dark outline
- subtle ring
- accessible text label

Never rely only on color.

Always include a text label such as:

```text
Dusty Pink
```

---

# 31. CART

Cart should be calm and editorial.

Desktop:

```text
Your Bag

Products                 Summary
                         Subtotal
                         Shipping
                         Total

                         [CHECKOUT]
```

Mobile:
- product first
- summary below
- sticky CTA where appropriate

Do not add decorative flowers between every item.

---

# 32. CHECKOUT

Checkout should maximize trust.

Use:

```text
Contact
Shipping Address
Shipping Method
Payment
Order Summary
```

Keep one clear primary CTA.

No unnecessary navigation distractions.

---

# 33. ORDER DETAIL / TRACKING

Order timeline should be a proper visual component.

Desktop:
horizontal timeline where space allows.

Mobile:
vertical timeline.

Never allow labels to overlap or clip.

Use concise labels:

```text
Dibuat
Dikonfirmasi
Diproses
Dikemas
Dikirim
Tiba
Selesai
```

Descriptions can appear below the active step only.

---

# 34. AUTHENTICATION

Login/register pages should feel branded but not over-designed.

Use:

- cream canvas
- centered form
- simple floral line-art
- serif heading
- pink CTA
- clear validation

Example:

```text
Welcome back.

Masuk untuk melanjutkan
ke koleksi Mutya.

[ Email ]
[ Password ]

[ MASUK ]

Belum punya akun?
Daftar →
```

---

# 35. ADMIN UI

Admin remains functional and separate from the fashion storefront.

Style:

```text
white
cream
gray
pink accent
dense information
clear tables
```

Do not add large editorial photography or decorative floral walls to the admin.

---

# 36. COMPONENT SYSTEM

Reusable components should include:

```text

Prefer composition over one giant component.

---

# 37. COMPONENT RULE — AVOID UI FATIGUE

Do not use the same visual box repeatedly.

Card
Card
Card
```

Better:

Whitespace
Soft section
Product carousel

```

Visual rhythm matters.

---

# 50. FINAL DESIGN GOAL

The final Mutya website should create this reaction:

> **"Ini terasa seperti brand hijab premium yang benar-benar punya identitas."**

The customer should be able to:

```text
Discover
   ↓
Feel inspired
   ↓
Understand the product
   ↓
Find a preferred color/material
   ↓
Add to bag
   ↓
Checkout
   ↓
Track the order
```

The interface must be **fashion editorial first, e-commerce second, floral third**.

That balance is what makes Mutya feel premium instead of decorative.
