/**
 * MUTYA STORE — curated demo-image manifest (development / academic use only).
 *
 * Deterministic mapping: category slug -> one verified Pexels photograph that
 * genuinely depicts a hijab / modest-fashion subject. An image is NEVER mapped
 * to an unrelated category merely to fill an empty card: if a category has no
 * entry here, the seeders skip it and report it as pending manual sourcing.
 *
 * VERIFICATION STATUS (2026-10-09, from this sandbox):
 *   - images.pexels.com CDN downloads for BOTH photo IDs below were fetched
 *     successfully and validated as genuine JPEG payloads (magic bytes FF D8 FF).
 *   - The pexels.com HTML pages could NOT be opened from this sandbox (blocked),
 *     so on-page titles/photographer credits are UNVERIFIED here. Both IDs come
 *     from the user-supplied source list whose page slugs describe hijab/modest
 *     fashion subjects. Verify visually before any launch.
 *
 * License: Pexels License (https://www.pexels.com/license/) — free for
